1. structure the transmit implementation
transmit_send(data, len)
when the packet is full then ring back (index + 1) % tx_desc_len

but when it's really full ,just return -E_NO_MEM to sys_pack_send
then the syscall will do some ipc_message to tell the caller it's full and you
need to resend or what.
